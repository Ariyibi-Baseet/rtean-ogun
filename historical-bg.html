            The Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN)
            officially commenced operations in Ogun State in 1978 under the
            leadership of a grassroots and professional transporter, Alhaji
            R.Adeola who served as the pioneer Chairman. Alhaji Adeola's most
            remarkable legacies in his eighteen years Administration
            (1978-1996), include, among others, the propagation of the Union and
            its protection from invasion, by the sister union.
            <br />
            In 1996, Chief R.A Adeyi, a retired Police Officer took over and
            introduced new initiative and civilisation into the Union. Within
            his eight year tenure, (1996-2004), he created five zones namely
            Abeokuta, Awori, Ijebu, Remo and Yewa zones. He encouraged the
            youths to join RTEAN. Chief Adeyi, later rose to become the National
            Deputy President, Operations of the union before he retired and
            Alhaji Mugisu Oluwarotimi Akinpelu who served as the Treasurer under
            the leadership of Chief Adeyi became the Chairman of the Union in
            the state. He held sway from 2005 to 2015 before his untimely death.
            <br />
            In his ten years tenure, he constructed and commissioned a landmark
            edifice for the Union tagged, RTEAN HOUSE which is strategically
            located in the heart of the State capital, Abeokuta. It is also on
            record that Alhaji Mugisu sponsored more than fifty members of the
            RTEAN to the holy pilgrimage.
            <br />
            Though the one week on, one week off, working arrangement that is
            still operational in Ogun State till date, had been mooted long
            before Alhaji Mugisu assumed office as Chairman, he however
            solidified it. It was under his watch that the Memorandum of
            Understanding between RTEAN and NURTW was signed, under the
            supervision of the state government in 2006.
            <br />
            It was this agreement that made it possible for the NURTW to extend
            their operations to Ijebu Ode while RTEAN also extended her
            operations to Agbado, Akute and Isheri areas of the state. Prior to
            that time, the former was not operating in Ijebu Ode and vice versa.

            <br />
            Alhaji Mugisu, while serving as the Chairman of the Union in Ogun
            State, also held, at different times, other positions. They include
            South West Chairman of the union, National Deputy President,
            Logistics and Planning as well as National Treasurer.
            <br />
            It is on record that he expanded the zones in the state to Eight.
            Upon the sudden death of Alhaji Mugisu, Alhaji Ahmed Kuku, his
            hitherto Deputy succeeded him and also served as the National
            Treasurer of the Union. Before leaving office, he created additional
            zones to make it FOURTEEN zones in the state.
            <br />
            RTEAN is currently led in Ogun State by Alhaji Titilayo Akibu
            otherwise known as Efele, a vibrant and visionary leader who despite
            being the youngest Chairman of the Union in the state, also serves
            as the National Treasurer of the Union. In a bid to empower members
            of the Union, he expanded the administrative structure to Twenty One
            Zones and Ninety Three Chapels, cutting across all the local
            governments and garages in the State.

            <br />
            Efele surprised many people in terms of performance. Aside
            repositioning the operations of the Union, particularly by
            discouraging some acts which he considered inimical to the growth of
            the transportation sector, he prioritised the welfare of his
            members, providing them insurance policies, free medical treatments,
            empowerment in different firms, including provision pleasure cars.

            <br />
            Efele, as he is fondly called also brokered a solid bond between the
            Union and the State Government, just as he ensured that the union
            continues to support the revenue generation of the government
            through Ogun State Internal Revenue.
